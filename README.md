# JsonStore

JsonStore is a lightweight layer of abstraction of documents that can be applied on top of your classes. It is mainly focused for relational databases, but can be extensible to any sotrage technology.

It also works as a micro-orm when using with the **JsonStore.Sql** extension package.
